Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification

Go to Google Account Security

Under “Signing in to Google”, find 2-Step Verification → click Turn On

Follow the steps to enable it (phone number, verification, etc.)

⚠️ You cannot generate App Passwords without 2-Step Verification.

Step 2: Generate App Password

Go to App Passwords

Sign in if prompted.

Under “Select app” → choose Mail

Under “Select device” → choose Other (Custom name) → type something like Go OTP App

Click Generate

Step 3: Copy the 16-character password

Google will show a 16-character password in groups of 4, e.g.:

abcd efgh ijkl mnop


Remove the spaces when putting in .env:

GMAIL_EMAIL=swapnilshilpa05@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop


✅ Done! You can now use this App Password in your Go program to send OTP emails via Gmail.
